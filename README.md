Creating a neural network to predict the possibility of someone getting heart disease within 5 years

Neural networks have been a recent discovery within the field of computer science, and have been used in many different scientific fields. For example, neural networks and other machine learning networks such as bayesian networks, have been used in the healthcare field. This is due to the fact that doctors cannot diagnose a patient quick enough so using artificial intelligence makes disease/disorder diagnosis faster and more efficient

In this neural network, I focus on heart disease, and given an input of certain attributes or features of a person, the network should be able to decipher the probability of the person getting a diagnosis for heart disease within the next five years.

So, firstly, I will explain a few machine learning concepts present in the neural network 


Neural networks
- neural networks are designed to learn a certain concept given a dataset, and since computers can process a lot of information, they can train the data and "learn" to generalize information from the given data.


Neurons and densel-connected layers



Gradient descent




Propogation and backpropogation



If you have any other further questons regarding any of these topics, as they are very difficult to understand, I recommend watching these videos by 3Blue1Brown. He does a great job of explaining these difficult concepts.

Also, for this particular neural net, I used the cleveland dataset from the UCI repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data

Ok, so now I am going to explain what each line of my code does, and the overall format of the neural network.
